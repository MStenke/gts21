Build the CI/CD Infrastructure
------------------------------

While creating the containerized version of Fiesta, we used a text editor (ex. `vi` or `nano`) to manipulate files. While these tools can certain do the job, as we've seen, this method is not exactly easy, or efficient to modify files on a large scale. Instead, we are going to use *Visual Studio Code*. Once we have *Visual Studio Code* installed and configured, we will setup our CI/CD pipeline using *Drone*.

*Visual Studio Code* is a free source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.

*Drone* by Harness is a modern Continuous Integration (CI) platform that empowers busy teams to automate their build, test and release workflows using a powerful, cloud native pipeline engine.

.. note::

   Estimated time **30 minutes**

We need to build the CI/CD pipeline. For this we are going to setup the following parts:

   - Visual Studio Code (VSC) - controls the Commit and push of the new code
   - Gitea - version control manager
   - Drone - CI/CD part of the pipeline

Visual Studio Code (VSC)
........................

#. Remote Desktop into your *UserXX*\ **-WinToolsVM**.

#. Open Visual Studio Code, and click on **View > Command Palette...**.

   .. figure:: images/1.png

#. Type **Remote SSH**, and select **Remote-SSH: Connect Current Window to Host...**.

   .. figure:: images/2.png

#. Click on **+ Add New SSH Host...** and type **ssh root@<DOCKER-VM-IP-ADDRESS>**

   [screenshot]

#. Select the location where you want to update the config file. Your choice.. [LET'S SPECIFY THIS FOR CONSISTENCY FOR ALL USERS]

#. Select **Connect** (bottom right corner) to connect to the VM

   [screenshot]

#. Answer the following, if you get the questions from VS Code [If?]

   - O/S - Linux
   - Fingerprint - Continue
   - Password - nutanix/4u

   [screenshot]

#. Click on both messages that may pop-up in the bottom right hand corner, the **Don't Show Again** button.

   .. figure:: images/3.png

#. Click the **Files** button from the left-hand pane, and then select **Open Folder**.

   .. figure:: images/4.png

#. Provide the **/** as the folder you want to open and click on **OK**

   [screenshot]

   It will take approximately 1 minute (you might be asked for the password again) [Confirm if they will or not].

#. Now you should see [will they?] the folder structure of the VM. Expand **root > github** to see the files we created earlier.

   .. figure:: images/5.png

This method of modifying files is easier than ``vi`` or ``nano``. [Are we just showing them a graphical viewer, that has no other benefits? Check back on this to ensure VSC has other value!]

Preparation [?]
...........

As we already have created the needed infrastructure using `docker-compose`, we're going to pull the existing yaml file, make changes and start the CI/CD pipeline.

#. Open a ssh session to your *Initials*\ **-docker-vm** by using VSC's built in terminal.

#. In VSC click on **Terminal ->  New Terminal**. This will open a new ssh session to the machine you had already opened to see the "remote folder" and saves switching between windows

   .. figure:: images/6.png
   .. figure:: images/7.png

#. In the terminal run the following commands to get the needed directories

   .. code-block:: bash

       mkdir -p ~/github
       mkdir -p /docker-location/gitea
       mkdir -p /docker-location/drone/server
       mkdir -p /docker-location/drone/agent
       mkdir -p /docker-location/mysql

#. In the Terminal of VSC, run ``cd ~/github``
#. Run the command ``curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wessenstam/gts2021-prep/main/CI-CD%20Pipeline/docker_files/docker-compose.yaml -O`` to pull the yaml file
#. To make sure we're not blocked by any rate limit on pulls, run ``docker login`` and authenticate using your dockerhub account you created earlier
#. In the terminal screen run the command ``docker-compose create db gitea`` and wait for the command prompt to return. You will see that images are pulled and at the end that the two services have been created

   .. figure:: images/9.png

#. Run ``docker-compose start db gitea`` to start the MySQL and Gitea containers.

Now that we have part of our CI/CD running, we need to configure it. We start with Gitea and end with Drone.

------

Gitea configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To make sure we can use https with Gitea, we need to go into the gitea docker container. Run a command and define what we need. Then we can configure Gitea to use the Self Signed SSL certificates.

#. Run ``docker exec -it gitea /bin/bash``
#. In the docker prompt run ``gitea cert --host <IP ADDRESS OF THE DOCKER VM>``. This will create two files **cert.pem** and **key.pem** in the root of the container.

   .. figure:: images/10.png

#. Copy the \*.pem files using ``cp /*.pem /data/gitea``
#. Run ``chmod 744 /data/gitea/*.pem``
#. Close the docker connection using **<CTRL>+d**
#. Open a browser and point it to **http://<IP ADDRESS DOCKER VM>:3000**
#. Make the following changes:

   - MySQL section:

     - **Host**: <IP ADDRESS OF YOUR DOCKER VM>:3306
     - **Password**: gitea


   - General Settings:

     - **SSH Server Port**: 2222
     - **Gitea Base URL**: \https://<IP ADDRESS OF YOUR DOCKER VM>:3000

   .. figure:: images/11.png

#. Click the **Install Gitea** button

Now you will receive an error that **This site canâ€™t provide a secure connection**, but we are going to change that.
In VSC, as we have all files for the containers being saved on the docker VM in the earlier created folders in /docker-location, we can change a file that is needed by Gitea and holds the config.

#. Open your VSC
#. Open the file **/docker-location/gitea/conf/app.ini** and make the following changes under the **[server]** section:

   - **PROTOCOL**  = https
   - **CERT_FILE** = cert.pem
   - **KEY_FILE**  = key.pem

     .. figure:: images/12.png

#. Save the file and restart the container using ``docker-compose restart gitea`` in your terminal windows in VSC
#. Reloading the browser page will show an error on the certificate, which is logical as we are now using a Self Signed certificate. Use the normal ways to get to the login screen.
#. The first user will be the admin user of the Gitea application (default)
#. Click the **Register button** to create an account. Provide whatever you want. We are going to use **nutanix**, **nutanix@atnutanix.com** and **nutanix/4u** during the workshop as examples.
#. Click the Register button to have your account created. Welcome to Gitea!!!

   .. figure:: images/14.png

------

Drone configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As Drone will use Gitea for its authentication, we need to get some parameters from Gitea and change the docker-compose.yaml file.

#. In your gitea click **Settings** by clicking on the Avatar in the right hand top corner

   .. figure:: images/15.png

#. Select Applications and fill the following parameters (under the **Manage OAuth2 Applications** section):

   - **Application name:** drone
   - **Redirect URI:** \http://<IP ADDRESS OF YOUR DOCKER VM>:8080/login

#. Click the **Create Application** button
#. Copy from the next screen the Client ID and the Client Secret

   .. figure:: images/16.png

#. Open the **docker-compose.yaml** file in VSC and paste the values in their field names **DRONE_GITEA_CLIENT_ID** and **DRONE_GITEA_CLIENT_SECRET**

   .. figure:: images/17.png

#. Also change under the **drone-server** section in the docker-compose.yaml file

   - **DRONE_GITEA_SERVER=** \https://<IP ADDRESS OF DOCKER VM>:3000
   - **DRONE_SERVER_HOST=** \https://<IP ADDRESS OF DOCKER VM>:8080
   - **DRONE_USER_CREATE=** <USERNAME> to **nutanix**

   .. note::

     If you have chosen a different username (not nutanix) in Gitea, make sure you change the needed parameters in the docker-compose.yaml file (drone-server section  **DRONE_USER_CREATE=username:nutanix,admin:true**)

#. Change under the **drone-docker-runner** section

   - **DRONE_RPC_HOST=** <IP ADDRESS OF DOCKER VM>

#. Save the file
#. Click in Gitea UI the **Save** button and then the **Dashboard** text
#. Open the Terminal in VSC
#. Create and start the drone server and agent container by running ``docker-compose create drone-server drone-docker-runner`` and ``docker-compose start drone-server drone-docker-runner``
#. Open a browser and point to **\http://<IP ADDRESS OF DOCKER VM>:8080**. This will try to authenticate the user **nutanix**, the defined user in Drone section in the docker-compose.yaml file with admin right
#. A warning **Authorize Application** message is shown, click on **Authorize Application**

   .. figure:: images/19.png

#. The Drone UI will open with nothing in it

We have just created our first CI/CD pipeline infrasturcture. **But** we still have to do a few thing...

- The way of working using **vi** or **nano** is not very effective and ready for human error (:fa:`thumbs-up`)
- Variables needed, have to be set outside of the image we build (:fa:`thumbs-down`)
- The container build takes a long time and is a tedeous work including it's management (:fa:`thumbs-down`)
- The start of the container takes a long time (:fa:`thumbs-down`)
- The image is only available as long as the Docker VM exists (:fa:`thumbs-down`)

The next modules in this workshop are going to address these :fa:`thumbs-down`.... Let's go for it!
