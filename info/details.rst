   If your cluster details are not found, first verify you have entered the same e-mail address used to register for GTS (and not an alias), otherwise contact **gts@nutanix.com** and request to be added.

In addition to providing network and credential information, you will also be given a **USER ID** (ex. USER01, USER02, etc.).

Unless explicitly instructed otherwise, you will use this value to label assets (VMs, policies, etc.) created throughout the labs. This value also identifies applications and VMs that have been pre-staged for you in order to more efficiently complete the labs.

Do **NOT** access any **USER** labeled VMs that are not assigned to you.
