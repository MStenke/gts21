**Welcome!** This year we're celebrating how we power customer use cases by exposing you to exciting new hybrid cloud use cases enabled by our core platform, our portfolio products, and Nutanix Clusters on AWS. Here's a quick look at the available labs:

   - **Hybrid Cloud IaaS**

      Take self-service to the next level with Nutanix ServiceNow integrations. Expand, migrate, secure, and automate your operations.

    - **Hybrid Cloud Database Management**

      Provision, clone, patch, and monitor Microsoft SQL Server across multiple clouds with Nutanix Era and Prism Ultimate.

   - **Hybrid Cloud EUC**

      Find out how you can go from hundreds to thousands of Citrix Desktops in hours versus weeks. Use Calm Runbooks to build powerful, repeatable automations.

   - **Containerizing Apps and CI/CD**

      Learn about the benefits and challenges of re-platforming applications first hand.

   - **Cloud Native Apps on Nutanix**

      Lift and shift may not be for you, but there are still economic and security benefits to running your containerized apps on-prem. Deploy and manage Nutanix Karbon and Objects, plus third party integrations, to deliver a full infrastructure stack to support Cloud Native Apps.

Should I Copy Name & IP Information Directly From Snapshots?
............................................................

**NO!** Screenshots are meant to provide navigational context. Screenshot values such as **XYZ** and **USER00** should be replaced with your actual initials or user ID value, as directed in the text of the lab. Similarly, IP addresses used should be relevant to **YOUR** cluster/VM/application/etc.

Where Is The Lab For Provisioning Clusters?
...........................................

**On the way!** Enablement is finishing a standalone Bootcamp that will focus on teaching you how to provision a cluster with AWS and deploy a VPN virtual appliance. Unfortunately the logistics for delivering something like this as part of GTS *just don't work* (lack of AWS baremetal capacity, time taken to "stage" cluster post-provisioning to complete additional labs, etc.).

We'll communicate to the field as soon as this is ready for on-demand self-enablement!

How Long Do I Have Access To The Labs?
......................................

The lab environments will be available all day Tuesday and Wednesday. The labs will be supported by a team of SMEs during the following periods:

- **Tuesday** -
- **Wednesday** -

Do I Have To Complete The Lab Tracks In Order?
..............................................

Within a **Lab Track** (ex. **Hybrid Cloud EUC**), inidividual exercises should be completed in order (**Getting Started -> Provision and Expand -> ...**). However, you should be able to complete the tracks in your order of interest.

How Many Labs Should I Complete?
................................

With 1.5 days of supported lab time, you should be able to complete **at least** 3 of the available lab tracks.

What Happens To The Labs Post-Event?
....................................

Following the event, we will be integrating the GTS labs into new and existing Bootcamps for you to drive prospect and customer engagement during 2021.

How Do I Get My Cluster Assignment Info?
........................................

See :ref:`clusterdetails` for complete instructions.

How Do I Get Support?
.....................

Supporting virtual events can be tricky, but to keep the experience familiar for users we made the conscious decision to not introduce new 3rd party tools, instead opting for a process that relies on both **Slack** and **Zoom**.

See :ref:`help` for complete instructions.

How Do I Validate My Labs?
..........................

This year we're introducing self-service validation requests to keep you focused and productive.

See :ref:`validate` for complete instructions.
